                    <p class="text-muted">
                        By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you, please read them
                        carefully before using the app.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-muted">KeeMobile shall not be used for any criminal, illicit and illegal acts, and
                        you accept and agree not to violate any law of any jurisdiction that you are originating from.
                        You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                        extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other
                        languages or make derivative versions. The app itself and all intellectual property rights
                        related to it belong to KeeMobile.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">KeeMobile is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as
                        possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its
                        services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services
                        without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
                        therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                        removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your
                        device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise
                        your phone’s security features and it could mean that the KeeMobile app won’t work properly or
                        at all.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">With respect to KeeMobile’s responsibility for your use of the app, when
                        you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it
                        is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so
                        that we can make it available to you. KeeMobile accepts no liability for any loss, direct or
                        indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available
                        on Android – the requirements for the system may change, and you’ll need to download the updates
                        if you want to keep using the app. KeeMobile does not promise that it will always update the app
                        so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on
                        your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to
                        you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without
                        giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                        rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and
                        (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        If you forget or lose your master password or key file there is no way to recover the data
